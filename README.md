# xeneta-tech-task

A small prototype to showcase 2 products structured, developed and maintained as a frontend monorepo with a shared library.

## Tools
1. For charts I used _recharts_ as for this demonstration it was simple, easy to use and good enough. If I had to choose something for a bigger project, I would prefer more powerful and customizable libraries like _d3.js_ or _echarts_.
